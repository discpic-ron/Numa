# Numa
**What is Numa?**

Numa is a tiny, self‑contained intelligence designed to live entirely on the user’s device.  
It doesn’t rely on servers, data centers, or massive models. Instead, it grows from the knowledge the user gives it. Numa isn’t built to know everything.
It’s built to know you.

**Why does Numa exist?**

Numa's pure existence is to help you without the need for bigger servers and higher costs.  It exists to prove that intelligence doesn’t need a data center to feel useful or alive. By staying small and local, Numa gives users something modern AIs rarely offer: control. Everything it knows stays on their device.
